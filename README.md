#Congratulations!

Well done on making it to the Final of WorldSKills UK. You have shown your skills in the heat and it is now time to prove yourself in the finals. The finals will see a major step up from the heats. This is to gain alignment with the possibility of becoming a squad member of the WorldSkills International team. 
Please read this training manual. This document will give you everything you need in order to compete at a very good level at the finals. However, please do not think that using this alone will gain you the Gold Medal in Web Design. You will need to do your own revision and research into the emerging trends of web design as well as contemporary ways of coding websites. 
This manual is split into Intermediate and Advanced. Advanced finalists should look at both parts of the manual as it will all be useful for the final. Intermediate finalists are more than welcome to use the Advanced part of the manual. 
We hope that you do well and that this document is useful and engaging for each and every one of you. 

Please note that Adobe Dreamweaver users will not be able to use templates in the final. 

We wish you all the best in the coming finals.
